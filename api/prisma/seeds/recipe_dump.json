Sprinkle a generous amount of salt over the eggplant slices to draw out the moisture, then wipe it away when it's time to fry.· When you're baking the coated eggplant slices, it doesn't hurt to turn on the broiler at the end.

For this recipe, you can really taste the difference when you use ripe tomatoes and fresh (not dried) basil; the best olive oil and balsamic vinegar you can afford, and hand-grated Parmesan cheese instead of pre-packaged grated cheese.· Add flavor with garlic: As an alternative to adding minced raw garlic to the tomato mixture, cut a peeled clove of garlic in half lengthwise and lightly rub the cut side over the slightly roughened surface of the toasted bread to impart a hint of garlic flavor. Rub on a little more garlic for a stronger flavor, if you wish. But watch out: A little garlic goes a long way.· Be patient: Make the tomato mixture and let it sit for a couple of hours so the flavors can develop more complexity. Yes, the tomatoes may give off a lot of juice as they marinate, but if you think the mixture is too juicy come serving time, simply use a slotted spoon to lift out the bruschetta topping as you spoon it over the bread. Don't toss the liquid, though — lots of people love to dip into it with extra bread.
