                <p>
                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will

                    your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject

                <h3>9. Controls for do not track features</h3>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                    ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
                    standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
                    currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                    choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
